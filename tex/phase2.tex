\section{Introduction}

For many natural language processing applications, it is necessary to parse natural language sentences into intermediate representations of meaning. 

A common task in natural language processing is to parse a natural language sentence into an intermediary represenation which encapsulates the syntax and, possibly, the semantics of the sentence. For encoding the syntactic structure of a sentence, tree based representations are generally sufficiently expressive. However, 

\subsection{Beyond Syntactico-Semantics}

For many NLU applications, it is useful to parse utterances into a logical form resembling first order logic. However, various logical phenomena such as quantifier scope, negation, and modality lie outside the realm of semantics and, as such, are not captured by semantic graph representations. Therefore, for logic based applications, semantic graphs must be extended beyond syntactico-semantics to capture these extra semantic phenomena, which are considered part of near-side pragmatics.
