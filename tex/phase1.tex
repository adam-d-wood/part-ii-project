\section{Current Project Ideas}

My current project idea is to build a web based automatic annotation tool which converts natural language sentences into more useful graph-based meaning representations. In particular, the tool will target the English Resource Semantics framework for graph-based meaning representation. 

To transform natural language sentences into semantic graphs, the tool will use a parser based on hyperedge replacement grammars. The particular hyperedge replacement grammar used for parsing will be induced from existing treebank data using a grammar induction algorithm. 

The primary success criterion for the project will be a function of the accuracy of the parser on a dataset of manually annotated sentences.

\section{Potential Supervisors}

Dr Weiwei Sun (ws390) has agreed to supervise and is also the originator of the project.

\section{Computing Resources}

I will use my own computer for development, which has the following specs: 
\begin{itemize}
\item CPU: Intel Core i7-8550U @ 1.80GHz Ã— 8 
\item Memory: 16GB
\item Running Ubuntu 20.04.4
\end{itemize}

The main software requirements are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Node.js as a JavaScript runtime
\item TypeScript compiler
\item Git for version control
\end{itemize}
